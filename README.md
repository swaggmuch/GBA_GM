GBA4iOS
=======

A fast GBA emulator for the iPhone/iPod Touch based on version 1.8.0 of [gpSPhone by zodttd](https://github.com/zodttd/gpSphone). This version can be installed simply by tapping the button below on your iOS Device, or compiled directly in Xcode and deployed just like any other app. No jailbreak OR developer account required :)

__NOTE: MacBuildServer is under heavy load right now. If you're having trouble downloading the app, you'll just have to wait. I have no control over it unfortunately.__

__NOTE: FINAL RELESE.
